# FuzzPedal - Introduction
Fuzz Guitar Pedal Tutorial and Explanation

Improve the understanding and application of the following skills:
  - Practice :
    - Breadboard Prototyping
    - Through-hole Soldering
    - 3D Modeling and Printing

  - Theory :
    - Basic Electrical Schematics
    - Analog Filters
    - Voltage Divider

# Step 1 - Breadboard Prototyping
The following materials are necessary for this project :
  - Components :
    - 9V Battery
    - 10k Resistor
    - 100KÎ© Potentiometer* *Preferably a 100Ka potentiometer because a logarithmic (Log/Audio) scaling of the volume control will be perceived as linear by our ear
    - 1uF Capacitor
    - 100nF Capacitor
    - Diode (one of the following) :
      - Silicon Diode (0.7V Voltage Drop) i.e 1N914, 1N4148, 1N400X
      - Schottky Diodes (0.15-0.45V Voltage Drop) i.e 1N581X, 1N582X, 1N5711, BAT41-43, BAT45-49
    - NPN Transistor :
